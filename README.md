## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

Start the Streamlit web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

### Application Features

- Upload your dataset or use the provided sample data
- Configure model parameters through the sidebar
- View real-time predictions and model performance
- Download results and visualizations

## Model Information

The project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model stored in HDF5 format. This model is optimized for:

- Time series prediction
- Sequential data analysis
- Pattern recognition in temporal data

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

Follow the installation steps above to run locally.

### Cloud Deployment

The application is configured for easy deployment on cloud platforms:

- **Streamlit Cloud**: Push to GitHub and connect your repository
- **Heroku**: Includes `runtime.txt` for Python version specification
- **Docker**: Create a Dockerfile based on the requirements

### Environment Variables

Configure the following variables for production:

```
STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=8501
STREAMLIT_SERVER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`)
5. Create a Pull Request

## Development

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Maintain consistent formatting

### Testing

Run tests before submitting changes:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Performance

- **Model Loading**: Optimized for quick startup times
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Response Time**: Real-time predictions with minimal latency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port already in use**
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

**Module import errors**
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

**Model loading failures**
- Ensure the model file `model_lstm_refsys.h5` is in the correct directory
- Verify the model was trained with compatible library versions
